With the recent End of Maintenance and Support announcements for ISE 2.3, we need to start planning an upgrade to 2.4. Wondering if anyone here has already gone through this upgrade and what their experiences were. The upgrade process looks like a hell of an awful time (3-4+ hour upgrade time per node, changing Guest OS settings in VMware, etc.), and there are some things in the 2.4 release notes that don't give me warm fuzzy feelings about having a smooth transition.

I've been trying to help in creating a mod pack with a couple of friends. It got a bit out of date, so I've been going through updating all the different mods. Everything has been going fine until I get to ProjectRed, at which point they have a secondary installer rather than just letting you download things from an adfly or whatever. Whatever, more page views, they got some reason for it. I download. okay, so I got the game, downloaded it yesterday. When I start the game, it goes through the intro sequence fine, and gets to the main menu fine. However, when I either "go to safe house" or enter a heist, it loads for a few seconds, then crashes to desktop. I have gone through all of the resources that I can find to try fix this. I've used the secondary installers (directx for example), verified game cache, uninstalled/reinstalled, updated game drivers, even disabled the steam overlay Story begins: I cannot start my game!

Hey /r/civ! I have been successfully playing Civ 5 BNW for over 500 hours and all of a sudden this week, it stopped working for me. When I load Civ BNW off Steam, I can select which version I want, and no matter which version I pick, they all go to the black loadscreen but then it doesn't load. Nothing comes up on the black screen, and I've waited for almost an hour to make sure it wouldn't load. It then defaults to "Not Responding." Has anyone else had this issue? Does anyone Ok, so I asked for a refund the day after buying a game on Steam. Under UK- and for that matter EU- law, this is within statutory rights which are not voided by any contractual agreements. But whatever. So I sent an email: I wish to ask for a refund for this game, which was purchased on steam account "smurfkitty" on 18th September. This is due to grossly unsatisfying performance on the part of the developer (rather than technical incompatibility- in other words, the game is bad). New homeowner, actually closed on Friday. We turned the heat on in the house the other day went back to the house today and was out back looking around and noticed that the line running to the ac unit is frozen and the lines to the unit in the house is frozen. Also we had the heat on 72 and when we checked the thermostat it said the house was 62 so I guess the heat isn’t working either. Anyone could know what the issue. WARNING PLEASE READ!

I recently purchased a copy of borderlands 2 in the steam summer sale. This is the first time I've tried to run it and when I launch it in steam the borderlands launcher will load but as soon as I click play the whole system freezes and I have to hit reset on my computer (does not accept any keyboard or mouse input and has frozen image on screen).

Half life 2, Skyrim, Rage, Portal. Nothing. Skyrim loads to the first little loadup screen, with the guy standing on the edge of cliff overlooking the valley, but that's the only thing that will happen.
